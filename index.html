    <h1>Greek Connect</h1> <!--Need to get a logo-->
    <p>This will eventually be a hub exclusivly for Greek life on UNCO's campus</p>
    <p>Making chapter to chapter connection easier for individuals with positions in their chapters</p>
    <p>Direct contact with the school and each counsil's leadership.</p>
    <p>Using directories installed by FSL leadership this will be the center of communication for UNCO Greek Life</p>
    <p>Forget Groupme, snapchat and instagram this connection hub will merge the best aspects of each and 
        disregard the nonsense that makes each of those social platforms a PITA to use.
