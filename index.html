    <h1>Greek Connect</h1> <!--Need to get a logo-->
    <h3>Probably will change the name to GreekHub, not sure yet</h3>
    <p>This will eventually be a hub exclusivly for Greek life on UNCO's campus</p>
    <p>Making chapter to chapter connection easier for individuals with positions in their chapters</p>
    <p>Direct contact with the school and each counsil's leadership.</p>
    <p>Using directories installed by FSL leadership this will be the center of communication for UNCO Greek Life</p>
    <p>Forget Groupme, snapchat and instagram this connection hub will merge the best aspects of each and 
        disregard the nonsense that makes each of those social platforms a PITA to use.
    </p>

    <!--Main page will show public chapter events philanthropy/fundraising/social events-->
    <!--Each chapter will have a public hub and private hub-->
    <!--Public hub will show everything the chapter wants to display to the whole greek community-->
    <!--Private hub will be exclusive to each member in their respective chapter-->
